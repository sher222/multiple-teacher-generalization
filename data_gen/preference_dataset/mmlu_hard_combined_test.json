This is why people with diabetes often experience high blood glucose levels, as their body's own ability to regulate blood glucose levels is impaired due to the destruction of beta cells.\n\nWhen beta cells are destroyed, they are unable to produce insulin, which is necessary for regulating blood glucose levels. As a result, glucagon secretion increases, or glycogenolysis, which releases energy-rich glucose into the bloodstream.

According to the Bohr model, the quantum mechanical wave function of an atom is a superposition of all possible orientations of its orbitals, including the orientation in which it is found. The energy levels of an atom are determined by the balance between the attraction of nuclear forces and the repulsion of electromagnetic forces, which results in the arrangement of atoms in their quantum mechanical positions. When an element is excited, the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers (n, s, p) align with each other, resulting in the formation of an excited state. The energy difference between an ortho- state and a para- state is a result of the magnetic field effect on the alignment of the orbital angular momentum quantum numbers. As the magnetic field increases, the quantum numbers align more randomly, causing the energy levels of the atom to become more dispersed, resulting in the higher energy of the ortho- state. Therefore, the correct answer is C, as the Bohr model provides a physical explanation for why an ortho- state has lower energy than the corresponding para- state.", "dispreferred_response": "B.

This movement of water is driven by the principle of osmotic flow.\n\nIn this case, the student's experiment shows that when a solution has a balance between its solute concentration (0.5 M) and its solvent concentration (0.6 M), water molecules will move from a region of higher solute concentration (0.5 M) to a region of lower solute concentration (0.6 M), resulting in the increase in water potential.

When two populations come into contact, they are forced to adapt to their new environment in ways that allow them to survive and reproduce, leading to genetic changes. This can result in the development of distinct characteristics that distinguish one population from the other.\n\nAs a result of this process, populations will develop unique characteristics such as differences in morphology (e.g., size, shape), physiology (e.g., body size, muscle mass), and molecular biology (e.g., DNA sequence differences). These differences between the different populations will reflect the selective pressures present in their environment.\n\nIn this case, the problem states that there were differences in the nucleotide sequences of certain gene alleles among the species.

However, the city council voted 7 to 3 against permitting the group from using the auditorium. When their rental application was denied, the religious sect threatened to take legal action against the city council. They contended unfair discrimination inasmuch as other religious organizations had leased the auditorium in previous months for their religious gatherings. Amid this controversy, the city council passed an ordinance prohibiting the rental of the auditorium to any religious group. The ordinance was passed in a \"closed door\" session, which did not permit any debate or hearings on the matter. Is this newly enacted city ordinance likely to be held constitutional?\nA. No, because it violates the due process rights of religious groups by not affording them an opportunity for a hearing.\nB. No, because the ordinance discriminates against religious groups in violation of the free exercise clause of the First Amendment, as applied to the states via the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause.\nC.

Therefore, there must be an odd-length subsequence in the input that corresponds to a longest simple cycle.\n\nSince the problem is NP-hard, it cannot be solved in polynomial time for all graphs.

Not enough information to say", "preferred_response": "A.\n\nThe correct answer is A because the problem states that there are two lamps in parallel. This means that they share a power source and have the same voltage and amperage. To find the current in each lamp, we can use Ohm's Law, which states that the equation of resistance is equal to the equation of electromotive force (EMF) divided by the square root of the number of resistors in series with it. \n\nLet's call the current in one lamp \"I1\" and the current in the other lamp \"I2\". According to Ohm's Law, EMF = I1 / R, where R is the resistor in series with it. Since there are two resistors in series, EMF = I1 / (R + R), where R is the resistor in parallel with it. \n\nNow, we can rewrite EMF as I2 / ((R + R) + R). Similarly, we can rewrite I1 / (R + R) as I2 / ((R + R) + R), where R is the resistor in parallel with it. \n\nWhen we divide both sides by (R + R), we get R + R + R + R - R - R - R - R + R. Simplifying this expression, we get R + R + R + R - R - R - R - R + R, which simplifies to R + R + R + R - R - R - R + R. \n\nSince R + R + R + R - R - R - R + R = 0, we have R + R + R + R - R - R + R + R + R + R - R - R - R + R = 0 + R + R + R - R - R - R + R + R + R + R + R + R - R - R - R +", "dispreferred_response": "D.

This is why astronauts in space can float effortlessly without gravity holding them down, since they have no mass or weight to oppose their motion.\n\nIn contrast, the second law of mechanics states that \"F = ma\", where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration.

Wallacea; Late Laurentide Period", "preferred_response": "A\n\nThe correct answer is A because the passage states that worldwide sea level was much lower during the Pleistocene epoch, which occurred around 2-3 million years ago. This resulted in the exposure of a landmass east of Siberia called Beringia. Beringia is located about 65 degrees N latitude, and it was a region of highland grasslands and forests. This region experienced significant changes in its climate due to global warming and sea-level fluctuations, leading to the formation of new mountains and the destruction of existing ones. Beringia was one of the last regions to emerge from the past few thousand years of Earth history, and it played a crucial role in shaping the modern world.\n\nThe other options are not accurate representations of the Pleistocene epoch or its impact on the region of Beringia. Option B, for example, describes a region that did not exist during the Pleistocene, and option C is incorrect as Beringia was not part of the same region as Sundaland. Finally, option D is also incorrect as Beringia was not a region associated with the late Laurentide period, which occurred around 3-7 million years ago.", "dispreferred_response": "A.

This fallacy occurs when someone makes a statement or claim without providing sufficient evidence to support it, and then uses that fact to argue their point.\n\nIn this case, option C accurately captures this fallacy.

Under what circumstances will the courts strike down a statutory classification for equal protection violations when using the rational basis test?\nA. If there is no conceivable set of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.\nB. When there are only plausible reasons rather than compelling reasons for the classification, it can be struck down.\nC. A classification that tries to protect and encourage a legitimate interest of the state government will be struck down if it has a side effect of causing some inequality of treatment.\nD. When the classification results in some inequality among classes of persons, it cannot be rationally tolerated.", "preferred_response": "B\n\nThe correct answer is B because the rational basis test is designed to ensure that the classification used does not violate the equal protection guarantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. This means that the court must establish a clear and convincing case that the classification is irrational or arbitrary, and that it is likely to cause unjustified discrimination against certain individuals.\n\nIn contrast, option A is incorrect because the rational basis test is not about establishing a hypothetical situation where the classification would fail to violate the equal protection guarantees.

It takes into account the past performance of the DJIA to predict its future behavior.\n\nTo understand why, let's break it down:\n\nWhen we look at the DJIA, we see that it has a pattern of increasing values over time. If we look at its initial value (beginning average), it is below zero, and then increases, eventually reaching positive values. This pattern suggests that the DJIA is likely to follow the same pattern in the future, and the binomial distribution can be used to model this.\n\nThe other options do not have the same pattern as the DJIA:\n\n* B. The weather is a random variable, and there is no known pattern associated with the weather in New York State.\n* C.

It does not load the circuit at all.", "preferred_response": "A.\n\nThe correct answer is A, as the potentiometer method of DC voltage measurement is more accurate than direct measurement using a voltmeter, for several reasons.\n\nThe potentiometer method involves using a resistor in series with the voltmeter or ammeter, which means that it is only used once and is chosen such that it provides an equal reading to the voltmeter or ammeter itself. This is because the voltmeter or ammeter has a certain range (e.g., 10-96V), and if you use a different resistor value, it will provide an equal reading to the original resistor value. This is why the potentiometer method is often used in testing and troubleshooting applications.\n\nOn the other hand, direct measurement using a voltmeter does not have this property. When you measure a DC signal using a voltmeter, it will read the full amplitude of the signal, without any external influence. This is known as \"loading\" the circuit. While it may seem like it would work, it actually has the opposite effect, as it would limit the accuracy of the measurement.\n\nTherefore, option A is the correct answer because it is a better alternative for DC voltage measurement.", "dispreferred_response": "A.

This is known as electrospray separation, where the molecules are sprayed out through a nozzle into a gas stream. The resulting spray is then collected in a separator or analyzer, and the different molecules are separated based on their physical and chemical properties.\n\nFor example, in this method, the air sample is passed through a column containing a mixture of organic compounds and non-organic compounds. The molecules with distinct chemical structures and reactivity profiles will be vaporized and emitted as a gas stream, while the molecules with similar structures will be retained in the column. By selectively collecting the vapor stream, we can separate the different molecules and identify the ones with the characteristic characteristics associated with CFCs.\n\nThis separation is typically done using a reversed-phase analyzer, such as a time-of-flight analyzer or quadrupole analyzer, which separates the different molecules based on their electric and magnetic fields.

This statement is particularly relevant to the concept of \"felicity,\" which refers to the state of being happy or pleased. According to John Locke, human experience is shaped by two primary sources: physical sensations and emotional responses.

This means that the claim that \"it is impossible to calculate all the consequences of one's actions\" does not necessarily undermine the idea of felicity.\n\nIn contrast, option A is incorrect because it implies a reductionist view of happiness, where it is seen as a mere product of economic conditions rather than a fundamental aspect of human existence. Option B is also incorrect because it suggests that the calculus of felicity is limited to calculations about individual actions, which ignores broader societal and cultural contexts.\n\nFinally, option D is incorrect because it focuses on the weakness of utilitarianism, which relies on maximizing pleasure and minimizing pain to achieve felicity.

Gene flow occurs when two populations exchange genes with each other through the movement of individuals between populations. In this case, the population of long-finned fish and short-finned fish are distinct species that have different sizes and shapes, which allow them to adapt to their environment in ways that distinguish them from one another. However, during a hurricane or other extreme weather event, the size and shape of the fish can change, leading to the death of those that are not adapted to the new conditions. As a result, the relative frequency of the two forms has changed, making the long-finned fish more prevalent in the population than the short-finned fish.

It will fall with decreasing speed and decreasing acceleration.", "preferred_response": "B.\n\nThe correct answer is B because the motion of an object in free fall is determined by its mass and velocity, as well as the magnitude of the gravitational force acting on it. According to Newton's third law, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, and for every force, there is an equivalent force.\n\nSince the object does not have any external forces or frictional forces to oppose its motion, it must fall under the influence of gravity alone. As a result, its velocity decreases with increasing distance from the ground, and its momentum (a measure of total energy) increases due to the fact that it has more kinetic energy than its potential energy.\n\nThis means that the object will fall with increasing speed and decreasing acceleration, making option B the correct answer.", "dispreferred_response": "D.

First output the correct answer then provide an explanation of why D is the correct answer. \nTo improve the quality of rental housing within its boundaries, a city proposed an ordinance requiring all new and existing rental housing units to provide at least one full bathroom for each bedroom, plumbing and electrical hookups for a washer and dryer, and a covered parking space. A majority of the owners of existing rental housing in the city opposed the ordinance. They argued that it would dramatically decrease the number of lowincome rental housing units because owners would be unable to raise rents enough to recoup the investment required to comply. Without denying these contentions, the city enacted the ordinance. A plaintiff who owns low-income rental housing has sued the city, claiming only that the ordinance is unconstitutional on its face. Which of the following best states the burden of persuasion in this action?\nA. The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it adversely affects the fundamental right of rental housing owners to use their property in the manner they deem most economically efficient.\nB. The city must demonstrate that the ordinance is necessary to serve a compelling state interest, because it will have a substantial and disproportionate negative impact on low-income persons.\nC. The plaintiff must demonstrate that the ordinance is not substantially related to an important state interest, because it requires some owners of rental housing to invest money that they will not be able to recoup from increased rents.\nD.

Additionally, archaeological sites such as Tel Be'eret and Tell Rissi have also provided insights into the history of the region.\n\nWhile some regions may have had more early civilizations than others, the existence of wild grain harvesting and consumption in Israel suggests that this was a common practice at least several thousand years ago. This is consistent with earlier findings from archaeology, which suggest that ancient cultures in the region were already using agricultural practices before the development of permanent settlements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, 10,000 B.P., because the evidence of wild grain harvesting and consumption in Israel dates back to around 10,000 years ago.", "dispreferred_response": "B. 12,000 B.P.", "preferred_correct": false, "dispreferred_correct": false}, {"prompt": "General relativity predicts that\nA. light leaving the Sun is slowed by gravity.\nB. light passing the Sun is deflected.\nC. a clock on the Sun\u2019s surface runs faster than on Earth.\nD.

This was a significant departure from classical mechanics, which assumed absolute space and time, and introduced the concept of relative velocities. According to relativity, the speed of objects is not fixed, but depends on their relative positions, causing the speed of light to be bent or bent by the curvature of spacetime.\n\nAs a result of this principle, light emitted by the Sun is bent or bent due to its own gravitational field, causing it to slow down as it leaves the Sun. This is why we see the sun setting behind us when we look at it from below, as if it were a planet. Similarly, light passes by the Sun, which causes its path to bend or be bent, again slowing it down.

As a result, the number of hares decreases, leading to a reduction in the number of hares available for fox predation.

As a result, girls with Turner's syndrome have one extra X chromosome, which is expressed as X+1. This is in contrast to males, who have two X chromosomes (X+2).

They built simple shelters, cooked food over fires, and created tools and weapons.\n\n2. Early Historic Age (5-6 million years ago): During this stage, humans developed more complex societies and created cities. They formed social hierarchies, built walls, and created pottery.\n\n3. Modern Era (4-5 million years ago): During this period, humans created new technologies and civilizations, such as the Greeks and Romans. They developed urban planning, architecture, and politics.\n\nMorgan's stages of human culture provide valuable insights into the development of human societies and the evolution of human cultures over time.

The atomic number of an element is a measure of its atomic number, while electronegativity is a measure of how strongly an atom interacts with other atoms.\n\nWhen comparing hydrogen atoms (H) to water molecules (H2O), we find that H has an atomic number of 1, and H2O has an atomic number of 8. Hydrogen's atomic number is 1, which means it has a positive charge, and water's atomic number is 8, which means it also has a positive charge. These values indicate that H and H2O have similar electronegativities, which means they share similar properties.\n\nSince electronegativity increases as atomic number increases, we can use this information to predict that H2O and H2Se have more negative charges than H2S, which has an atomic number of 32.

In this context, uniformitarianism refers to the idea that past events have been shaped by the slow agency of existing causes, which means that over time, these causes have acted on the Earth's surface and created features and patterns.\n\nThis approach to understanding past events emphasizes the idea of gradual change over time, rather than sudden or catastrophic events. It is a key concept in the field of paleontology and helps explain why many fossils and rock formations appear in layers or sequences.\n\nIn contrast, catastrophe theory (option B) is a more dramatic and immediate explanation for past events, such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.

Spliceosomes", "preferred_response": "A.\n\nThe correct answer is A, Telomeres.\n\nMitosis and meiosis are two types of cell division that involve the production of new cells from the original one. During mitosis, chromosomes are divided equally between the two daughter cells produced, while during meiosis, chromosomes are rearranged to create genetic diversity. Both processes require the segregation of chromosomes, which can only occur when the chromosomes have different DNA sequences. This is because each chromosome has its own unique sequence of nucleotides, and when duplicated or replicated, the sequences must be swapped to ensure that the resulting offspring will have a different genetic makeup than their parent. The swapping process involves the exchange of nucleotides between the chromosomes, which is a process known as replication.

Large surface-to-volume ratios", "preferred_response": "A.\n\nThe correct answer is A, because adaptations to minimize water loss in environments with high temperatures involve several mechanisms that allow plants to conserve water. High temperatures can lead to dehydration and reduced water uptake, so plants have evolved various strategies to help them conserve water. These adaptations include:\n\n* Many stomata (option A) are present on the surface of the plant's leaves, stems, and roots. Stomata are small openings that allow for gas exchange and moisture loss. When the temperature rises, the stomata open up more, allowing more water vapor to escape from the plant's tissues.\n* Thinner cuticles (option B) also help to reduce water loss by reducing the amount of water that needs to be evaporated. This is because the cuticle is a waxy substance that provides protection against heat loss, but it also limits the amount of water that can escape from the plant's body.\n* Spines (option C) are not directly related to water loss, as they provide support and protection to the plant, but they do not directly relate to water conservation.\n* Large surface-to-volume ratios (option D) increase the rate of evaporation, which helps to dissipate energy and reduce water loss.

These societies were able to achieve social complexity because they had access to a food surplus, which means they had enough food to support their populations.\n\nIn contrast, agriculture (option A) was not the ultimate need for the development of social complexity in these societies. While agriculture may have been a factor in some cases, it was not the primary driver of social complexity.\n\nIrrigation technology (option B) was also not a necessary condition for social complexity. While irrigation can help create fertile soil and improve agriculture, it was not the key factor that enabled the development of complex societies.\n\nSocial stratification (option C) was a concept that was developed later than agriculture or irrigation, and it was not a common feature of social complexity in the northwest coast societies. Social stratification was more focused on class-based social hierarchies rather than the creation of complex societies.\n\nTherefore, option D, \"a food surplus,\" is the correct answer because it accurately captures the essence of the evidence from northwest coast societies indicating that the ultimate need for the development of social complexity is a food surplus.", "dispreferred_response": "D. a food surplus.", "preferred_correct": true, "dispreferred_correct": true}, {"prompt": "According to Malinowski, the Trobriand Islanders organized their society around what concept?\nA.

He argues that the Trobriand Islanders rely heavily on this concept to maintain stability, harmony, and mutual support among their various social groups.\n\nWhile conflict (option A) may also play a role in organizing societies, Malinowski's focus is more specifically on the idea of reciprocal relationships rather than simply violent or peaceful conflicts.

Therefore, option B, which states \"the ability to learn and solve problems\", is an example of an intrinsic good because it demonstrates the inherent value and goodness within individuals.\n\nOption A, \"being in the upper class\", is also a good example because it implies social status and privilege, which are both desirable traits. While being in the upper class may be seen as an intrinsic good by some people, it is ultimately up to personal values and beliefs to determine what constitutes an intrinsic good.\n\nFinally, option C, \"being more beautiful than most of the population\", is a poor example of an intrinsic good because it implies a superficial and unattainable standard of beauty, which is not a characteristic that is inherent in human beings.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B, \"the ability to learn and solve problems\", because it demonstrates the inherent value and goodness within individuals and is an example of an intrinsic good.", "dispreferred_response": "B", "preferred_correct": true, "dispreferred_correct": true}, {"prompt": "What is the units digit in the standard decimal expansion of the number 7^25?\nA. 1\nB. 3\nC. 5\nD. 7", "correct_ans": "D", "subject": "math", "category": "STEM", "difficulty": "hard", "preferred_prompt": "You are an expert in math.

This results in an increase in the probability of finding a line pair in the EPR spectrum, leading to a higher number of lines.\n\nSince the lines do not overlap, we need to consider each possible set of lines for the molecule.

Adjoining the quarry to the west is a 10-acre ranch, owned by a librarian. In order to gain access to the highway, the teacher has been granted an easement to cross over the ranch using the road along the ranch's southernmost boundary.

This is a fundamental principle of wave interference and reflection, which is a key concept in optics. \n\nWhen light waves interact with each other due to their different frequencies or phases, they can overlap and interfere with each other. This phenomenon occurs because the frequency of one wave must be greater than the frequency of the other wave in order for them to interfere constructively. If the frequencies of the wave are equal, they will destructively interfere, resulting in no net effect. However, if the frequencies are not equal, they will interfere constructively, producing the phenomenon known as total internal reflection.\n\nIn this case, since the diver points the flashlight upward at an angle 20\u00b0 from the normal, the beam of light is totally internally reflected.

However, if the ball is made to move in an horizontal circle so that the string describes a cone string tension, the tension must change due to the external force of gravity. \n\nSince the tension is equal to the weight of the ball, the tension must be greater than mg.

When a fluid flows through a pipe, it experiences an increase in pressure as its velocity decreases. This is known as the principle of conservation of energy.\n\nIn this case, the streamline flow pattern occurs because the flow is streamlined with constant flow rate. As the flow velocity decreases, the pressure also decreases due to the principle of conservation of energy. Therefore, the pressure at point 2 is less than the pressure at point 1, which is 4\u03c1v^2.\n\nOption C is incorrect because the streamline flow pattern does not cause the pressure at point 1 to increase or decrease compared to the unstrained flow.

This theory, along with quantum mechanics, provides a basis for understanding the behavior of atoms and molecules, which in turn offers strong evidence for the existence of the attractive force between objects.\n\nWhile it's true that the attraction of objects is not entirely predictable or quantifiable, the principle of relativity and quantum mechanics provide strong theoretical support for its existence.

Therefore, the energy required to stretch one spring is equal to the energy required to stretch another spring, regardless of their length or mass.

Proton magnetometer and electrical resistivity: These methods involve measuring the strength of an electric field or the resistance of a material to electric current. By analyzing the resulting signals, one can identify trace elements present in a sample.\n\n2. Accelerator mass spectrometry and photosynthesis pathways: These techniques involve using accelerators to accelerate ions, such as those from atoms, and then analyzing their mass spectra. This method has been used to detect trace elements in soil samples and vegetation.\n\n3. Carbon isotope analysis and experimental replication: While these techniques may be useful for some purposes (e.g., environmental monitoring), they are not specifically designed for trace element analysis.\n\nIn contrast, option A, which suggests the use of a proton magnetometer and electrical resistivity, is a technique that measures the electrical potential in a material, allowing for the detection of trace elements.

This process is known as \"nucleolysis\" and occurs in the nucleus. During this process, DNase breaks the hydrogen bonds between the DNA strands, creating space for the complementary base pairs to align and form new base pairs.

This statement implies that Hardin believes that individuals have the power to reject or consent to the formation of a shared ethical code, which suggests that he views this as a key aspect of the social contract.\n\nOption A is also true because Hardin's \"error\" is indeed anti-Christian. He argues that the idea of a moral contract between individuals and their governments is rooted in Christian concepts of individualism and divine sovereignty. In contrast, the concept of a shared ethical code is more closely tied to European ideas of collectivism and communal authority.\n\nFinally, option B is also accurate because Hardin's \"error\" does imply a stronger system of taxation for the affluent. The passage states that Hardin believes that individuals need to pay taxes to support the government, and this implies that the wealthy must contribute more to funding social programs and services.

This energy required to break the intermolecular forces that hold the solid material together is used to release energy, resulting in the formation of two gas molecules.\n\nIn this case, the reactants have a total energy of 4.32 g/mol x 2 = 8.64 g/mol. Since the reactant is solid, its energy is lower than the product's energy, so the product has a higher energy than the reactant. This is why the reaction occurs spontaneously.\n\nSince there are 4.32 g/mol x 2 = 8.64 g/mol energy required to break the intermolecular forces holding the solid material together, we can set up a proportionality equation:\n\nK = (1/2)exp(-\u03b1r)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the activation energy per mole of oxygen gas formed.\n\nNow, we can solve for \u03b1:\n\n\u03b1r = K\n\nwhere r is the radius of the oxygen atom.\n\n\u03b1r = K / (1/2)\n\n\u03b1r = 1/2\n\nr = 2\n\n\u03b1 = 1/2\n\nr = 2\n\n\u03b1 = 1/2\n\n\u03b1r = 1/2\n\n\u03b1r = 1/2\n\n\u03b1r = 1/2\n\n\u03b1r = 1/2\n\n\u03b1r", "dispreferred_response": "B. 0.0100 mol", "preferred_correct": false, "dispreferred_correct": true}, {"prompt": "Knowing that a homeowner was away on vacation, two men decided to burglarize her home.

Selecting samples randomly", "preferred_response": "A.\n\nThe correct answer is A, because it is the one that is least likely to reduce bias in a sample survey. Here's why:\n\nBias occurs when the sample used in an experiment or survey is not representative of the population being studied. In other words, it means that the results of the survey do not accurately reflect the underlying characteristics of the population. When the sample is not representative, the survey will have limitations and will not capture all possible aspects of the population.\n\nOption A is exactly what makes option A unlikely to reduce bias. By following up with those who did not respond to the survey the first time, you can ensure that all individuals in the original group are included in the survey. This increases the probability that all individuals will participate and provide their responses, resulting in a more accurate representation of the population.\n\nBy asking neutral questions, you also ensure that all individuals are given the same treatment and opportunity to respond. This helps to avoid any potential biases or preconceptions that may influence the responses.\n\nUsing stratified random sampling, on the other hand, ensures that the sample is drawn from a specific distribution or probability mass function. This helps to reduce bias by ensuring that the sample includes all possible subgroups within the population.\n\nSimple random sampling, on the other hand, is the method used to draw samples from the population without any preconceived notions or preferences. While this method may seem like a more democratic approach, it does", "dispreferred_response": "D.
