The angular magnification of a telescope is given by the ratio of the focal length of the objective lens (the lens that collects light from the object being viewed) to the focal length of the eyepiece lens (the lens that the viewer looks through).\n\nHowever, in this question, we are not given the focal length of the objective lens. Instead, we are given the distance between the two lenses (100 cm) and the focal length of the eyepiece lens (20 cm).\n\nIn a refracting telescope, when the telescope is focused for a distant object, the distance between the two lenses is equal to the sum of their focal lengths.

        "preferred_response": "B.  The process where the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas is equal to the heat added to the gas is known as a constant volume process. This is because, in a constant volume process, there is no work done by or on the gas (since work is defined as pressure times change in volume, and there is no change in volume). Therefore, according to the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the change in internal energy of a system is equal to the heat added to the system minus the work done by the system, the increase in internal energy is solely due to the heat added to the gas. This makes the constant volume process the correct answer.",

The heat added to the gas is the difference between the initial internal energy of the gas and the final internal energy of the gas, which is equal to the work done by the gas molecules to change their temperature and volume.\nIn the case of an ideal gas, the internal energy of a gas is given by the formula:\nU = n * R * T\nwhere U is the internal energy, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.\nThe work done by the gas molecules to change their temperature and volume is given by the formula:\nW = n * m * (V^2 - V)\nwhere W is the work done, m is the mass of the gas molecules, and V is the volume of the gas.\nSince the temperature remains constant in an adiabatic process, the work done by the gas molecules to change their temperature and volume is zero. Therefore, the increase in the internal energy of the ideal gas is equal to the heat added to the gas:\nU = n * R * T = n * R * (V^2 - V)\nSince the pressure remains constant, the difference between the initial and final internal energy is equal to the heat added to the gas:\n\u0394U = n * R * T - n * R * (V^2 - V) = n * R * T - n * R * V\nSince the pressure remains constant, the difference between the initial and final internal energy is also equal to the heat added to the gas:\n\u0394U = n * R * T - n * R * V = n * R * T - n * R * V = \u0394U\nTherefore, the increase in the internal energy of an ideal gas is equal to the heat added to the gas, and the correct answer is D.

        "preferred_response": "D.  The correct answer is that angular momentum is conserved when there is zero net external torque (III). This is because angular momentum is a measure of the amount of rotation an object has, taking into account its mass, shape, and speed. It is a conserved quantity, meaning that it remains constant unless acted upon by an external torque. Torque is the rotational equivalent of force, and it is what causes changes in angular momentum. Therefore, if there is no net external torque acting on an object, its angular momentum will remain constant, and we say that angular momentum is conserved.\n\nThe other conditions listed in the question do not necessarily ensure that angular momentum is conserved. Conservation of linear momentum (I) refers to the fact that the total linear momentum of a system remains constant unless acted upon by an external force. However, this does not guarantee that angular momentum is conserved, as linear momentum and angular momentum are separate quantities that can change independently of each other.\n\nSimilarly, having zero net external force (II) does not necessarily mean that angular momentum is conserved. While it is true that a net external force can cause changes in both linear and angular momentum, it is possible for an object to experience a net external force without experiencing any torque. For example, if a force is applied to an object at its center of mass, it will cause the object to accelerate linearly, but it will not cause any rotation or change in angular momentum.\n\nTherefore, the only condition listed in the question that ensures that angular momentum is conserved is having zero net external torque (III).",
        "unpreferred_response": "D. III only\n\nAngular momentum is conserved when there is no net external torque acting on an object. A torque is a force that causes a rotation of an object about an axis. If there is a net external torque acting on an object, the object will experience a torque that causes it to rotate in the opposite direction of the torque. This means that the angular momentum of the object will change, and it will not be conserved.\n\nOn the other hand, conservation of linear momentum is a property of motion that states that the net force acting on an object will cause it to move in a straight line with constant velocity. This is a property that is independent of the direction of the torque acting on the object.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D. III only, as conservation of angular momentum is a property that is independent of the direction of the torque acting on an object, while conservation of linear momentum is a property that is dependent on the direction of the torque."

The pressure is at a node, but the particle displacement is at an antinode.\nExplanation: A standing wave is a wave that oscillates in a closed, symmetrical loop. In a pipe filled with air, the wave will propagate along the length of the pipe, and at each point in the pipe, the wave will have a node and an antinode. The node is the point where the wave's displacement is zero, and the antinode is the point where the wave's displacement is maximum. At the closed end of the pipe, the wave will have a node because the air is compressed, and the particles will be forced to move in a circular motion around the closed end. The particle displacement at the node is zero, and the pressure is at a node because the particles are at rest and the wave is compressing the air.

The energy of a photon is given by E = hf, where h is Planck's constant and f is the frequency of the light. Plugging in the given values, we get E = (6.626 x 10^-34 J s) * (1 x 10^15 Hz) = 6.626 x 10^-19 J. Since 1 eV = 1.602 x 10^-19 J, this corresponds to an energy of 4.136 eV.\n\nSince the work function of the photocell is 2 eV, the excess energy of the photon after ejecting an electron is 4.136 eV - 2 eV = 2.136 eV. This means that each photon that hits the photocell and ejects an electron will contribute 2.136 eV of energy to the current through the resistor.\n\nNext, we need to determine how many photons are hitting the photocell per second. The power of the light is given as P = 100 W, which is equivalent to 100 J/s. Since each photon has an energy of 6.626 x 10^-19 J, the number of photons hitting the photocell per second is N = P/E = (100 J/s) / (6.626 x 10^-19 J/photon) = 1.51 x 10^20 photons/s.\n\nFinally, we can calculate the current through the resistor.

The current through a resistor in series is the product of the voltage across the resistor and the resistance. In this case, the voltage across the resistor is V = P / f, where f is the frequency of the light.\nSince the work function of the photocell is \u03d5 = 2eV, the minimum energy required to excite a photon is 2eV.
