They advocated for a more decentralized system, where power was held closer to the people and the states.\n\nReagan's statement, \"the Federal Government did not create the States; the States created the Federal Government,\" reflects the Anti-Federalist view that the states are sovereign entities that voluntarily ceded certain powers to the federal government, rather than the federal government being the primary authority.

This obligation is not just a matter of personal preference or convenience, but a moral requirement that arises from the promise itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is C, both A and B, because making a promise creates both a right on the part of the promisee and an obligation on the part of the promisor.",

For example, in a situation where a doctor must choose between saving the life of a pregnant woman or saving the life of her unborn child, the doctrine of double effect would suggest that the doctor's action of saving the woman's life, which would also result in the death of the child, could be justified because it produces a greater good (saving the woman's life) even though it also has a bad effect (the death of the child).\n\nThis doctrine is often attributed to Thomas Aquinas, who used it to justify self-defense and other actions that might otherwise be considered morally wrong.

So no one will doubt that this form belongs to the heavenly bodies. \u2026\nThat the earth is also spherical is therefore beyond question, because it presses from all sides upon its center. Although by reason of the elevations of the mountains and the depressions of the valleys a perfect circle cannot be understood, yet this does not affect the general spherical nature of the earth. \u2026\nAs it has been already shown that the earth has the form of a sphere, we must consider whether a movement also coincides with this form, and what place the earth holds in the universe. \u2026 The great majority of authors of course agree that the earth stands still in the center of the universe, and consider it inconceivable and ridiculous to suppose the opposite. But if the matter is carefully weighed, it will be seen that the question is not yet settled and therefore by no means to be regarded lightly. Every change of place which is observed is due, namely, to a movement of the observed object or of the observer, or to movements of both. \u2026 Now it is from the earth that the revolution of the heavens is observed and it is produced for our eyes. Therefore if the earth undergoes no movement this movement must take place in everything outside of the earth, but in the opposite direction than if everything on the earth moved, and of this kind is the daily revolution. So this appears to affect the whole universe, that is, everything outside the earth with the single exception of the earth itself. If, however, one should admit that this movement was not peculiar to the heavens, but that the earth revolved from west to east, and if this was carefully considered in regard to the apparent rising and setting of the sun, the moon and the stars, it would be discovered that this was the real situation.\"\nNicolas Copernicus, The Revolutions of the Heavenly Bodies, 1543\nFrom the passage, one may say that Copernicus's argument for a spherical cosmos was based on\nA. observation and induction\nB. ancient textual authority\nC. experimentation\nD. deduction from first principles",

The Oration on the Dignity of Man, written by Pico della Mirandola in 1486, is a seminal work of Renaissance humanism. The passage emphasizes the potential of human beings to shape their own destiny, to choose their own path, and to achieve great things through their own efforts. This emphasis on human agency, individualism, and the potential for self-improvement is a hallmark of Renaissance humanism.\n\nAdditionally, the passage's focus on the dignity and worth of human beings, as well as its celebration of human creativity and potential, are all characteristic of Renaissance humanist thought. The Renaissance was a time of great cultural and intellectual transformation in Europe, marked by a renewed interest in classical Greek and Roman culture, as well as a focus on individualism, secularism, and humanism. Pico's Oration on the Dignity of Man is a quintessential expression of these values, and therefore, it is clear that he was participating in the Renaissance cultural movement.",

The Populist Party Platform of 1892 outlines a series of grievances against the existing political and economic system, including the concentration of power and wealth, the exploitation of the working class, and the failure of the government to address these issues. The platform also calls for a more democratic and equitable society, with a focus on the needs of \"the plain people.\"\n\nThe Progressivism of the early 1900s shared many of these goals. Progressives sought to address the social and economic problems created by industrialization, such as poverty, inequality, and exploitation. They advocated for reforms such as regulation of business, protection of workers' rights, and expansion of democracy. Like the Populists, Progressives believed that the government had a responsibility to promote the general welfare and protect the interests of ordinary people.\n\nIn contrast, Neoconservatism of the 1980s (option B) was a movement that emphasized limited government, free market economics, and a strong national defense. It did not share the Populist focus on social and economic reform. Federalism of the late 1700s (option C) was a movement that sought to establish a strong central government, which is not a key concern of the Populist Party Platform. Jacksonian Democracy of the early 1800s (option D) was a movement that emphasized the power of the common man and the importance of limited government, but it did not have the same focus on social and economic reform as the Populist Party.",

This is because the passage by Ibn Battuta, a renowned Arab traveler and scholar, describes the Islamic practices and social norms of the people in Mali during the 1300s. The presence of Islam in Mali during this period is likely due to the trans-Saharan trade network, which connected West Africa to the Mediterranean region and the Middle East. Muslim trade caravans played a significant role in this network, traveling across the Sahara Desert to exchange goods, ideas, and cultures.\n\nIt is probable that these trade caravans brought Islam to Mali, as they would have interacted with local populations, shared their beliefs, and established trade relationships. The fact that the people in Mali were Muslims, studied Islamic jurisprudence, and learned the Qur'an by heart, as described by Ibn Battuta, suggests a strong influence of Islamic trade networks in the region.\n\nIn contrast, options A, B, and D are less likely sources of Islam in Mali. Wandering Berber mystics (A) may have played a role in spreading Islam, but there is no evidence to suggest they were the primary source. Conquering Mughal armies (B) is an unlikely option, as the Mughal Empire was centered in India and did not have a significant presence in West Africa during the 1300s.
